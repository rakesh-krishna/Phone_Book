A Contact Management System using C++

DATA STRUCTURES USED : Hashing(Modulo hashing),Merge Sort

There is an hidden option(Option 10) to import contacts from a csv file(NOTE:Name of csv file musgt be "contact.csv")

To execute this cpp file in codeblocks make sure to do the following: 1.Click on Settings -> Compiler Settings. 2.Then make sure that the C++11 ISO checkbox is checked under Compiler Flags for it to work

Otherwise, You will get an error : " 'stoll' is not declared in the scope"

I have not added cuda in this repo.
